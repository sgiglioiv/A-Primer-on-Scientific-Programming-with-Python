#A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python by Hans Petter Langtangen
This will be working through the examples in the textbook A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python
by Hans Petter Langtangen.

It will have whatever I find useful in it.
It will also have worked out examples of the exercises in the book.

That's all for now.
